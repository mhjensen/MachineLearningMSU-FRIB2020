    "\n",
    "## Neural network types\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",
    "consists of layers of connected neurons, or nodes or units.  We will\n",
    "refer to these interchangeably as units or nodes, and sometimes as\n",
    "neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each\n",
    "neuron interact with other neurons by sending signals in the form of\n",
    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",
    "each neuron can be approximated mathematically as a convolution\n",
    "operation.  (figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks emulate the behaviour of neurons in the\n",
    "visual cortex by enforcing a *local* connectivity pattern between\n",
    "nodes of adjacent layers: Each node in a convolutional layer is\n",
    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One uses often so-called fully-connected feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "with three or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers\n",
    "and an output layer) consisting of neurons that have non-linear\n",
    "activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such networks are often called *multilayer perceptrons* (MLPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why multilayer perceptrons?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward\n",
    "neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite\n",
    "number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional\n",
    "function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for\n",
    "the hidden layer is a **non-constant, bounded and\n",
    "monotonically-increasing continuous function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to\n",
    "the hidden layer, the output nodes are always assumed to be linear, so\n",
    "as to not restrict the range of output values.\n",

Typically a *grid-search* is performed, wherein we test different hyperparameters separated by orders of magnitude.

    "* Estimate optimal error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimize underfitting (bias) on training data set.\n",

    "However, sometimes\n",

    "differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance\n",

    "on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This\n",
    "can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for\n",
    "supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.\n",

    "## Examples: Pulsar identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulsar classification can be one of the best training grounds for\n",
    "performing machine learning in astrophysics. These pulsars are said to\n",
    "be \"pulsating radio sources\", which have now been identified to be\n",
    "caused by rapidly rotating highly magnetized neutron stars and are\n",
    "detectable here on Earth . One of the characteristic properties of\n",
    "these pulsars is that they exhibit periodic bursts of emission\n",
    "produced by their radio emitting jets. The direction of their emission\n",
    "also rotates with them and sweep the sky like a lighthouse. This gives\n",
    "astronomers information about the phenomenon as they observe a pulse\n",
    "of radio emission each time one of the jets points towards the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study and detection of pulsars provide a wealth of information\n",
    "about the physics of neutron stars. They are also used as probes\n",
    "of stellar evolution. In addition, they are being used to test or\n",
    "verify some concepts in general relativity due to their extremely high\n",
    "densities. These allowed them to be good observables in detecting and\n",
    "mapping gravitational wave signatures. One problem, however, is that\n",
    "they are very difficult to identify in the large stream of data from\n",
    "radio telescopes. Moreover, a lot of man-made sources of radio\n",
    "frequency interference are also present, which can produce the same\n",
    "signals as pulsars. Hence, the classification of pulsars from possible\n",
    "candidate data is of great importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, pulsars are very weak radio sources. They are classified\n",
    "from a given data sample by first extracting information from the pool\n",
    "of data and then identifying which features or characteristics are\n",
    "relevant. Since the individual pulses are very much different,\n",
    "astronomers particularly stack them up and generate an integrated\n",
    "pulse profile for pulsar classification. This profile is the coherent\n",
    "addition of thousands of pulses together in a process known as folding\n",
    "[1]. Moreover, pulses will arrive at various times across different\n",
    "radio frequencies. The delay of these pulses from frequency to\n",
    "frequency is called dispersion and is said to be caused by the ionized\n",
    "inter-stellar medium. The method usually employed by astronomers\n",
    "is that they fit for the shape of the delay as to reduce its negative\n",
    "effect. However, as with all kinds of fitting procedures, there would\n",
    "always be an uncertainty associated with it. This is expressed in the\n",
    "so-called DM-SNR (\"dispersion-measure-signal-to-noise-ratio\")\n",
    "curve. Both the integrated profile curve and DM-SNR curve are used in\n",
    "identifying possible pulsar candidates. These curves provide eight\n",
    "numerical characteristic features as depicted and listed below. </div>\n",

    "For this dataset, there is already an initial classification of the\n",
    "potential pulsar candidates as pulsars and non-pulsars by the\n",
    "astronomy community. We aim here to perform machine learning and try\n",
    "to build a model that can detect patterns within the data. This will\n",

    "that will soon be observed."
